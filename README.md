# Cleaning-and-Getting-Data
Data Science John Hopkins Course

The run_analysis.R is commented for easy understanding of the code.

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

#Clear the Workspace
#Download and unzip the dataset
#Load activity lables as tables and convert the class of activity as characters
#Load features as tables and convert the class of features as characters
#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
#Load the training datasets, training lables and subject who performed the activity window sample (ranges from 1 to 30)
#Creating the train dataset
#Load the testing datasets, testing lables and subject who performed the activity window sample (ranges from 1 to 30)
#Creating the test Dataset
#Merge Testing dataset, Activities and Subjects
#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
#Convert activities & subjects into factors from activityLabels
#Convert Combineddata into a molten data frame

The end result is shown in the file TidyDataSet.txt.
